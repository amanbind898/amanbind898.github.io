# Personal Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio site created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This is my first project using vanilla JavaScript, focusing on building a clean, minimalistic, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Minimal UI**: Simple and elegant user interface for easy navigation and a clean look.
- **Unique Scroll-Bar**: Customized scroll-bar for a unique browsing experience.
- **Auto-Hiding Navbar**: The navigation bar automatically hides when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up, enhancing user focus on content.
- **SVG Animations**: Attractive and smooth SVG animations add a dynamic visual appeal to the site.
